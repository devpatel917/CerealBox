# CerealBox


Simulating the collecting of prizes from cereal boxes with the assumptions that there is one prize per box and there are 6 different boxes. 

The simulation answers the question: How many boxes do I need to buy before I will get all 6 prizes? A trial is considered to be over when I get all 6 prizes and a large number of trials are simulated. 

The median and mean of the number of boxes bought for each trial are displayed
